# ActionScript Notification Engine

A powerful cross-platform notification engine.

## Codename

Project M6D Magnum Sidearm

## Overview

M6D is a notification engine built on top of Adobe AIR.  With a very simple interface, you can drop it into your own desktop AIR project and use it to deliver messenger-style notifications to your users!  Think Growl, but for all platforms :)

## Features

M6D supports the following features...

* Ability to display messenger-style toast notifications as well as compact notifications.
* Variable display length for notifications.
* User-presence logic that detects when the user is at the computer.  If the user is away, notifications are held on-screen and queued for when the user returns.
* Ability to replay most recent five notifications.
* Individual notification post settings, such as sticky, replayable, custom image, click URL, compact, etc.
* Smart repositioning logic for sticky posts.
* Ability to see a summary notification if user is away for an extended period of time.
* Support for changing the notification images.
* Support for custom styling as well as changing styles on the fly.
